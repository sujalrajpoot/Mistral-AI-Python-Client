            cookies="your_authentication_cookies", 
            chat_id="your_chat_session_id"
        )

        # Chat with the AI
        response = client.chat("Hello, what can you do?")
        print("\nFull Response:", response)

        # Use a specific model
        code_response = client.chat(
            "Write a Python function to reverse a string", 
            model=ModelType.CODESTRAL
        )

        # Perform a web search
        search_results = client.web_search("Latest AI developments")
        print("\nSearch Results:", search_results)

    except AuthenticationError as e:
        print(f"Authentication failed: {e}")
    except NetworkConnectionError as e:
        print(f"Network error: {e}")
    except RateLimitError as e:
        print(f"Rate limit exceeded: {e}")
    except ModelUnavailableError as e:
        print(f"Model error: {e}")
    except InputValidationError as e:
        print(f"Input error: {e}")
    except MistralAIError as e:
        print(f"Unexpected Mistral AI error: {e}")
```
